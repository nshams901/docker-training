# Solution before docker
- configuration managment tools (chef, puppet, ansible)
    - require knowledge about hardware and operating systems.
- virtual machines as code ( Vagrant )
    - heavy, slow-ish, requires inconvenient configuration.

# Docker solved : ðŸ‘‡

- Dockers makes containers easy:
    - Configuration through Dockerfiles, not shell commands.
    - Share image with others through image registries.
    - A super easy command line client and API.

# Docker explained

- ##### Containers vs virtual machines
| Containers                        | Virtual Machines  |
| -------------                  |:-----------------:|
| Run in container runtimes      | right-aligned     |
| work alongside operating system   | centered          |
| Do not require OS configuration                     | are neat          |
| Run one app at a time ( usually )
